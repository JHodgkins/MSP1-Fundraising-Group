# Planning Research
Researching into fundraising groups for charities, I established that most volunteer groups have used social media facilities such as Facebook pages or private group pages within a social platform.
This offers many features such as:
- Most people own a smartphone or computer today have access to these platforms
- The platform offers direct communication and shareability
The downsides for certain groups of people can be:
- It can be overwhelming for some users using assistive technology or an inexperienced or the older age group user of social media.
- Not all users want to sign up for an account to access information

It is worth noting that recently data collection and privacy have been highlighted through news reports and people are finding new alternative platforms to connect and find out information that they require.
Looking into what was available to the local fundraising group through the main charity, I found that.
- The charity does not currently offer ways for local fundraising groups to have a specific page within their main website to highlight local fundraising group activities or upcoming events
To share content this must be done through sharing through a social media page to the regional office or sending a request to post on the page.
This could mean posts may be missed if the regional office posts frequently or can delay a post appearing if there are current national campaigns happening at the same time.
The downside to a social platform is that while the reach can be vast, thee pages which share content must be followed or liked to see the post originally.
