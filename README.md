## Overview
The Hertford and Ware Fundraising Group fundraising site is a website catering for a local community group of volunteers located within east Hertfordshire, the areas they fundraise are Hertford, Ware and Welwyn Garden City.
The website has been developed with its main purpose to provide a platform for current group members to stay up to date with upcoming events and collections, a platform that they can easily share their fundraising activities with friends, family, and those within the community to encourage new recruits to the fundraising group.  
The business purpose of the platform is to demonstrate an established community fundraising group to entice and instil confidence to other groups, schools or businesses to collaborate and encourage donations from donors to support the fundraising groups cause.  
The sites expected target audience will be to those that would like to fulfil volunteering time through work, to persons who have more available spare time and are looking to meet or join a group of people from within the local community.  
The website will provide to new visitors a well-rounded positive feeling site demonstrating local community spirit which will inspire and promote a positive feeling whilst providing excitement for new opportunities for those visiting to become involved in volunteering as well as make a monitory contribution if they wish bringing a warm feeling that they have played their part to made a difference to someone living with a visual impairment.
