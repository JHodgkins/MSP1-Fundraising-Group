                <p class="card-text">
                  We are a group of around 20 volunteers based around the areas of Hertford, Ware and Welwyn Garden City.<br>
                  Our group members are made up from a variety of ages ranging from early 20's to retirment age, we have two Guide Dog owners and multiple Puppy wa;kers who volunteer and participate in the events and collections.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  The group arranges events and collections in January for throughut the year so we can raise money and boost awareness of Guide Dogs throughout the local area.<br>
                  While many people see Guide Dogs working on our local streets, the group events allow people to see the dogs up close and have a chat with their owners to find out about their sight loss journey and to ask any questions they may have about owning a Guide Dog.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Often is the case, someone knows someone going through sight loss and as a group we are able to direct those who are wondering how to sign up for services or even to reasure people at times that sight loss does not mean the end of independance.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The first four British guide dogs - Judy, Flash, Folly and Meta - completed their training at Wallasey, Wirral in 1931, and three years after this The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association was formed.<br>
                  This would not have been possible without the work of Muriel Crooke and Rosamund Bond, German shepherd breeders who trained the first guide dogs.<br>
                  The first permanent trainer for Guide Dogs was Captain Nikolai Liakhoff, who came to England in 1933. In 1941, the organisation's premises at The Cliff in Wallasey was commandeered for war purposes and the Guide Dogs moved to new premises in the centre of England at Leamington Spa.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  In 1956 Guide Dogs began to recruit volunteers to become puppy walkers. A few years later a breeding programme was introduced and by 1970 these components of Guide Dogs’ work had grown so much they were given their own premises at Tollgate House, near Leamington Spa.<br>
                  The most influential figure in the development of Guide Dogs’ puppy walking and breeding programmes was the late Derek Freeman MBE.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  In 1964, the charity's work was introduced to a new generation when the children's television programme Blue Peter launched an appeal to collect silver foil and milk bottle tops. Blue Peter raised enough to fund two guide dog puppies, Cindy and Honey, and the programme followed their training.<br>
                  This feature has been repeated in the early 1980s, in 2006 with Andy Akinwolere with puppy Magic and in 2014 with another puppy, Iggy.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Guide Dogs holds the Guinness World Record for the largest number of guide dogs trained by an organisation, which stands at 33,910 guide dogs by the end of 2016.<br>
                  The charity also holds world records for the Largest Virtual Tea Party, achieved in April 2020 when thousands of people posted a photo of themselves enjoying a cup of tea at home on Guide Dogs’ Facebook page.<br>
                  In 2021, the charity is celebrating the 90th anniversary of the UK’s first four guide dog partnerships with a host of activities including an artisan, sensory garden at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.
